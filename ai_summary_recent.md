In the last 30 days, I've discovered that talking to my computer is completely changing how I work - and the numbers tell quite a story! I speak about 4,200 words daily (think: the length of a detailed blog post) in just 40 minutes of talking time. That's saving me nearly 20 hours of typing this month alone!

What I love most isn't just the time savings - it's how natural everything feels now. Instead of being hunched over a keyboard, I can lean back in my chair, gesture while I think, and watch my words appear on screen while my hands are free to point things out or grab a coffee. It's like having a conversation with a really good assistant who types everything perfectly.

The freedom to multitask is game-changing. When working with AI tools, I can direct changes and watch them happen in real-time, like conducting an orchestra instead of playing every instrument myself. I find myself expressing ideas more naturally too - speaking around 113 words per minute feels so much more fluid than typing.

I typically use voice input about 69 times throughout the day, usually hitting my stride on Wednesday afternoons. It's become as natural as talking on the phone, but instead of calling someone, I'm creating documents, writing emails, or coding while keeping my workflow smooth and uninterrupted.

If you've been curious about trying voice input, these numbers show it's not just a gimmick - it's a genuinely different way to work with your computer. Imagine being able to work while pacing around your office or gesturing to emphasize points during a presentation. That's the kind of freedom voice input gives you. Why not give it a try? Your voice might just become your new favorite productivity tool!
