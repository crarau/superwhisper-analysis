In the last 30 days, I've been talking instead of typing - and it's completely changed my daily routine! Think of it this way: I speak about as much as you'd talk during a coffee catch-up with a friend (around 40 minutes each day), but instead of the words just floating away, they're all captured as text.

Each day, I speak about 4,200 words - that's roughly the length of a lengthy blog post or a short story. The cool part? I'm doing this while walking my dog, folding laundry, or just relaxing on the couch. By talking instead of typing, I'm saving nearly 20 hours each month - that's like getting a whole free day back!

I typically reach for voice-to-text about 69 times per day, usually for quick thoughts, replies, or notes. It's become as natural as sending a voice message to a friend. Wednesdays at 1:00 PM seem to be when I'm most chatty (maybe it's the post-lunch energy!).

What amazes me most is that in just 30 days, I've spoken over 126,000 words - that's about the length of a decent-sized novel! And all this happened just by talking at a normal pace, about as fast as you'd tell a story to a friend.

If you've been thinking about trying voice-to-text, I'd say go for it! It's like having a personal assistant who writes down everything you say. Start small - maybe with text messages or quick notes - and you might be surprised how naturally it fits into your day. Trust me, your fingers will thank you!
