## üó£Ô∏è Example: Recent Activity Insights

Here's a sample of the user-friendly insights you'll get about your voice recording habits:

> **In the last 30 days**, I've been talking instead of typing - and it's completely changed my daily routine! Imagine having a casual 40-minute conversation every day; that's about how much I speak to my device. I average about 4,200 words daily, which is roughly the length of a lengthy blog post or a short story.
>
> Here's what amazes me: **I'm saving nearly 20 hours per month** just by speaking instead of typing. That's like getting back an entire weekend! I find myself reaching for voice input about 69 times throughout the day - pretty much whenever I need to write anything longer than a quick text.
>
> The coolest part? I'm speaking at a comfortable pace (about 113 words per minute), which is nearly twice as fast as if I were typing. It's like the difference between walking and riding a bike - same destination, but you get there so much quicker! I tend to be most chatty on Wednesday afternoons, usually around 1 PM when my creative energy is flowing.
>
> If you're curious about trying voice-to-text, I'd absolutely recommend it. It's as simple as talking to a friend, and you might be surprised how natural it feels after just a few days. Think about all the things you could do with an extra 20 hours a month - that's a lot of Netflix shows, walks in the park, or quality time with family!

*This is the kind of personal, relatable summary the AI generator creates from your own SuperWhisper data - perfect for sharing with friends or inspiring others to try voice-to-text technology!*

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/~/superwhisper-analysis.git
cd superwhisper-analysis
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Optional: Install AI dependencies** (for summary generation):
```bash
# For OpenAI GPT-4 summaries
pip install openai

# OR for Anthropic Claude summaries  
pip install anthropic
```

## üìÅ Setup

1. **Configure your SuperWhisper recordings path** in `config.py`:
```python
RECORDINGS_PATH = "~/Documents/superwhisper/recordings"
```

2. **Make sure your SuperWhisper recordings are accessible** (if using iCloud, ensure they're downloaded locally or the script will handle the sync automatically)

## üéØ Usage

### Quick Start - Full Analysis
```bash
python superwhisper_analysis_fast.py
```

### Text Analysis & Time Savings
```bash
python superwhisper_text_analysis.py
```

### AI-Powered Summary Generation
```bash
python ai_summary_generator.py
```
Creates beautiful, shareable summaries perfect for LinkedIn, blogs, or presentations using OpenAI or Anthropic APIs.

**Features:**
- Choose between OpenAI (GPT-4) or Anthropic (Claude) 
- Works without AI (fallback summary)
- Generates markdown formatted summaries
- Perfect for social media posts and presentations

### First Run (Large Dataset)
The first run will:
- Cache all `meta.json` files locally for faster future processing
- Process files in parallel to handle large datasets efficiently
- Create a `.pkl` cache file for instant future analysis

**Expected time**: ~10 minutes for 7,000+ recordings
**Future runs**: ~5 seconds (uses cache)

## üìä Output Files

The analysis generates several files:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy Note

This tool processes data locally and does not send any information to external servers. All analysis is performed on your machine using the metadata from your SuperWhisper recordings.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### iCloud Sync Issues
If you encounter slow processing due to iCloud sync:
- The script automatically handles this by creating a local cache
- First run may take longer as files download from iCloud
- Subsequent runs will be much faster using the local cache

### Large Datasets
For datasets with thousands of recordings:
- Use `superwhisper_analysis_fast.py` for optimized processing
- Enable parallel processing (default: 8 workers)
- Monitor progress with built-in progress bars

### Memory Issues
If you encounter memory issues with very large datasets:
- The script processes data in chunks
- Cache files help reduce memory usage
- Consider running analysis on smaller date ranges if needed

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on GitHub.
